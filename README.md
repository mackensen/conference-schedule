# Conference Schedule

I originally created this plugin for the HighEdWeb Association regionals to display their schedule online.

You can see the plugin in action on [the HighEdWeb New England website](http://ne16.highedweb.org/schedule/), on [the WPCampus 2016 website](https://2016.wpcampus.org/schedule/), and on [the WPCampus Online website](https://online.wpcampus.org/schedule/).

## For Development

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the repo in your terminal
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `gulp`.
